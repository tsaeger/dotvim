## Background

This vimrc has grown through the years, lifted much of it from others.
Plugins are now restructured for use with pathogen using gitsubmodules to stay current, most are sourced from GitHub.

Much of the inspiration (can vimrc's be inspiring?) for the restructuring can be traced back to:
[thechangelog episode 0.5.6](http://thechangelog.com/post/4557774334/episode-0-5-6-vim-with-drew-neil-tim-pope-and-yehuda-kat)
and watching many of Drew Neil's [vimcasts](http://vimcasts.org/)
